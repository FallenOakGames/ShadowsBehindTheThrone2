What do I actually DO?

Need UI Vote result message

Text doesn't disappear

Utilility values too high on some things (title assignment, it seems)

[TRIAL FIX] Barely any liking gain from voting on-side

Turns left on vote

Way to sway people towards particular fears

Doesn't say which way the judgement votes are going
	Main screen, left "Voting on: set military stance to 2"

No info should be given for liking reasons if the source is enthralled

Society collapsed without me being given enough warning

Fishmen should grow much slower
More sea tiles

[TRIAL FIX] Society lacked unlanded people

Events should say how many there are, and how strong the highest one is

Ideally a second-level title to be awarded

Utility too low on judge suspect

One ability per turn

Combat damage stats on event screen

Say who called vote on the events

Big message for "You are in a new society"

Indicate which way you are already voting on vote screen

Prestige gains too slow

Need prestige target indicator on main screen

Vote reasons go off screen if there are too many suspicious people

Need a way to get suspicion's actual value

Unsure if map mask manager sees real suspicion

It says "View society" for switching back to world from society screen

[Possible feature] Unholy flesh military growth hella slow

Military stance utilities seem too high

Suspicion gain far too slow

Remove introspection's stability gain

Reduce reluctance to condemn

Too many people on soc screen. Highly cursed

People need to fear societies with highly suspicious nobles

Cap max liking gain from vote?

More liking from being voted for with titles

Declare war on worms: 250 liking

Suspicion string in map mask needs rounding

Victory multiply achieved

Cheat box needs togglable hiding
------------


[FIXED] Reduce permanent threat gain?

[FIXED] Colours a bit strong in dislike view? -26 seemed very red

[FIXED] Can declare war when at war

[FIX] Add preference to voting for high-prestige people for sovreign
