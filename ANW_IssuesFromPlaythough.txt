What do I actually DO?

Need UI Vote result message

Text doesn't disappear

[Possibly fixed] Utilility values too high on some things (title assignment, it seems)

Turns left on vote

Way to sway people towards particular fears

Doesn't say which way the judgement votes are going
	Main screen, left "Voting on: set military stance to 2"

No info should be given for liking reasons if the source is enthralled

Society collapsed without me being given enough warning

Fishmen should grow much slower
More sea tiles

[TRIAL FIX] Society lacked unlanded people

Events should say how many there are, and how strong the highest one is

Ideally a second-level title to be awarded

Combat damage stats on event screen

Say who called vote on the events

Big message for "You are in a new society"

Indicate which way you are already voting on vote screen

Prestige gains too slow


Vote reasons go off screen if there are too many suspicious people

Need a way to get suspicion's actual value

Unsure if map mask manager sees real suspicion

It says "View society" for switching back to world from society screen

[Possible feature] Unholy flesh military growth hella slow

Military stance utilities seem too high

Suspicion gain far too slow

Remove introspection's stability gain

Too many people on soc screen. Highly cursed

People need to fear societies with highly suspicious nobles


More liking from being voted for with titles


Suspicion string in map mask needs rounding

Victory multiply achieved

Cheat box needs togglable hiding
