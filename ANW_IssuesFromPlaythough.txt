--------------HELLA CRITICAL---------------

Apoptosis can kill anyone

Society view doesn't give selected person's voting preferences

--------------PRETTY BAD HONESTLY----------

What do I actually DO?

missing flavour text across the board

Events should say how many there are, and how strong the highest one is

Ideally a second-level title to be awarded

Big message for "You are in a new society"

Indicate which way you are already voting on vote screen

[STILL BROKEN] Suspicion string in map mask needs rounding

------------BASICALLY A FEATURE, WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT IT--------------

Wrong number of abilities displayed on button

Ideally have a "selected item glow" on scrollables

[Possibly fixed] Utilility values too high on some things (title assignment, it seems)

Turns left on vote

[Partially done] Way to sway people towards particular fears

No info should be given for liking reasons if the source is enthralled

More sea tiles

Mouse clicks still go through

Need a way to get suspicion's actual value

Unsure if map mask manager sees real suspicion

Military stance utilities seem too high

Mac support fails to cap framerates

Event Messages still invisible on startup



------------NON-ZERO CHANCE THAT IT'S FIXED------------------

[FIXED] Too many unlanded people

[FIXED] Too many people on soc screen. Highly cursed
[DONE] It says "View society" for switching back to world from society screen
[DONE] Escape goes to main menu
[DONE] Quit button from main menu
[DONE] People need to fear societies with highly suspicious nobles



[DONE] Combat damage stats on event screen
[Possible feature] Unholy flesh military growth hella slow

[FIXED] Doesn't say which way the judgement votes are going
	Main screen, left "Voting on: set military stance to 2"


[DONE] People need to fear societies with highly suspicious nobles

[DONE] Society collapsed without me being given enough warning

[FIXED] Remove "You may propose a vote with your enthralled". Since it may be in cooldown

[FIXED] Too many people on soc screen. Highly cursed

[FIXED] Say who called vote on the events

[TRIAL FIX] Society lacked unlanded people

[POSSIBLE FIX] More liking from being voted for with titles

[FIXED] Fishmen should grow much slower

[FIXED?] Suspicion gain far too slow
[FEATURE NOT BUG] Remove introspection's stability gain

[FIXED] Victory multiply achieved
[FIXED] Cheat box needs togglable hiding

[NOT BUG] Prestige gains too slow

[FIXED] Need UI Vote result message


[FIXED] Vote reasons go off screen if there are too many suspicious people

[FIXED] Need prestige target indicator on main screen

[TRIAL FIX] Barely any liking gain from voting on-side
[FIXED] Reduce reluctance to condemn
[FIXED] Cap max liking gain from vote?
[FIXED] Declare war on worms: 250 liking

[FIXED] Utility too low on judge suspect

[FIXED] One ability per turn



[FIXED] Reduce permanent threat gain?

[FIXED] Colours a bit strong in dislike view? -26 seemed very red

[FIXED] Can declare war when at war

[FIX] Add preference to voting for high-prestige people for sovreign
