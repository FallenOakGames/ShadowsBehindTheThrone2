What do I actually DO?

Ideally have a "selected item glow" on scrollables

[Possibly fixed] Utilility values too high on some things (title assignment, it seems)

Turns left on vote

[Partially done] Way to sway people towards particular fears

No info should be given for liking reasons if the source is enthralled

More sea tiles

Events should say how many there are, and how strong the highest one is

Ideally a second-level title to be awarded

Wrong number of abilities displayed on button

Big message for "You are in a new society"

Indicate which way you are already voting on vote screen

Need a way to get suspicion's actual value

Unsure if map mask manager sees real suspicion

It says "View society" for switching back to world from society screen

Military stance utilities seem too high

Too many people on soc screen. Highly cursed
