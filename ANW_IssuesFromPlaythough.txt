What do I actually DO?

Can declare war when at war

One ability per turn

Vote response

Text doesn't disappear

Utilility values too high on some things (title assignment, it seems)

Barely any liking gain from voting on-side

Turns left on vote

Reduce permanent threat gain?

Colours a bit strong in dislike view? -26 seemed very red

Way to sway people towards particular fears

Suspicion string in map mask needs rounding

Doesn't say which way the judgement votes are going

No info should be given for liking reasons if the source is enthralled

Society collapsed without me being given enough warning

Fishmen should grow much slower
More sea tiles

Society lacked unlanded people

Events should say how many there are, and how strong the highest one is

Add liking as skill. Adds evidence, I guess, to counteract ease of use

Ideally a second-level title to be awarded

Utility too low on judge suspect

Add preference to voting for high-prestige people for sovreign
