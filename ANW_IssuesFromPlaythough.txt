--------------HELLA CRITICAL---------------


--------------PRETTY BAD HONESTLY----------

What do I actually DO?


Events should say how many there are, and how strong the highest one is

Ideally a second-level title to be awarded

Big message for "You are in a new society"

[STILL BROKEN] Suspicion string in map mask needs rounding

------------BASICALLY A FEATURE, WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT IT--------------


Militarism flavour in left hand side typo

Flashing mask in society view

Ideally have a "selected item glow" on scrollables

Words go off bottom of screen

Typo in end of unholy flesh spawn message

Turns left on vote

[Partially done] Way to sway people towards particular fears

More sea tiles

Need a way to get suspicion's actual value

Unsure if map mask manager sees real suspicion

Military stance utilities seem too high


Event Messages still invisible on startup



------------NON-ZERO CHANCE THAT IT'S FIXED------------------

[Possibly fixed] Mac support fails to cap framerates
[FIXED] Wrong number of abilities displayed on button
[FIXED] Mouse clicks still go through
[FIXED] missing flavour text across the board
[FIXED] Apoptosis can kill anyone
[Possibly fixed] Utilility values too high on some things (title assignment, it seems)

[DONE] Escape goes to main menu
[DONE] Quit button from main menu
[DONE] People need to fear societies with highly suspicious nobles



[DONE] Combat damage stats on event screen
[Possible feature] Unholy flesh military growth hella slow

[FIXED] Doesn't say which way the judgement votes are going
	Main screen, left "Voting on: set military stance to 2"


[DONE] People need to fear societies with highly suspicious nobles

[DONE] Society collapsed without me being given enough warning

[FIXED] Remove "You may propose a vote with your enthralled". Since it may be in cooldown

[FIXED] Too many people on soc screen. Highly cursed

[FIXED] Say who called vote on the events

[TRIAL FIX] Society lacked unlanded people

[POSSIBLE FIX] More liking from being voted for with titles

[DONE] Indicate which way you are already voting on vote screen

[FIXED] Fishmen should grow much slower

[FIXED?] Suspicion gain far too slow
[FEATURE NOT BUG] Remove introspection's stability gain

[FIXED] Victory multiply achieved
[FIXED] Cheat box needs togglable hiding

[NOT BUG] Prestige gains too slow

[FIXED] Need UI Vote result message


[FIXED] Vote reasons go off screen if there are too many suspicious people

[FIXED] Need prestige target indicator on main screen

[TRIAL FIX] Barely any liking gain from voting on-side
[FIXED] Reduce reluctance to condemn
[FIXED] Cap max liking gain from vote?
[FIXED] Declare war on worms: 250 liking

[FIXED] Utility too low on judge suspect

[FIXED] One ability per turn



[FIXED] Reduce permanent threat gain?

[FIXED] Colours a bit strong in dislike view? -26 seemed very red

[FIXED] Can declare war when at war

[FIX] Add preference to voting for high-prestige people for sovreign
