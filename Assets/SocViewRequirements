Voting:
	What the current vote is, which options are available, how much prestige total is behind each one, which was the map.overmind.enthralled (if non-null) is voting
	Expanded info (popup presumably):
		Who is voting for what. Worse case is that a soc has 64 people, all of them voting. Can limit max number of voting options to 8, if need be, but otherwise assume worse case is also 64
		
	When the next vote is, if none are available, and who will propose it (if the enthralled doesn't jump in)
	The queue for voting order
		Should be determinable from the society thing, since it calls them in some manner of order, which should be algorithmically deducible
Suspicion:
	Who suspects whom
Liking:
	Who likes whom
Threat:
	Overall what is the top threat of the society (on average)
	Sidebar scrollable for average threat of all, then specific threat assessments of selected indiviudual
	Each person can then have a scrollable set appear which says which threats they fear, and why (implemented already in prefabstore)
